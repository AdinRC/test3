# Daily Tasks Note & Dashboard 📝📊

A modern, web-based daily task note and dashboard application for teams, powered by Google Apps Script backend. This project allows users to record daily notes, track blockers, and view analytics and user management in a beautiful, responsive interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🗒️ **Daily Task Note Submission**: Users can submit their daily notes, including yesterday's accomplishments, today's focus, blockers, and context notes.
- 👥 **User Dropdown**: Dynamically loads user list from backend for easy selection.
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Secure login-protected dashboard for analytics and user management.
- 📈 **Analytics**: Visualizes submissions per person and over time using Chart.js.
- 🛠️ **User Management**: Add or remove users from the dashboard.
- 💻 **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look on all devices.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The frontend is a single HTML file (`index.html`) using Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and Font Awesome.
- All data (users, notes, authentication) is managed via a Google Apps Script web app (see `SCRIPT_URL` in the code).
- Users submit notes, which are sent to the backend and stored (typically in a Google Sheet).
- The dashboard provides analytics and user management, accessible after login.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Open the App**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.

2. **Submit a Daily Note**
   - Fill in the date, select your name, and enter your daily notes.
   - Click "Record Note" to submit.

3. **View Dashboard**
   - Click the "Dashboard" tab.
   - Log in with your credentials to access analytics and user management.

4. **Manage Users**
   - In the dashboard, switch to "User Management" to add or remove users.

## 🎨 Customization

- 🔗 **Backend Integration**: The app uses a Google Apps Script endpoint (see `SCRIPT_URL` in the JS). You can deploy your own script and update the URL as needed.
- 👤 **User List**: Managed via the backend; add/remove users from the dashboard.
- 🎨 **Styling**: Modify Tailwind classes in `index.html` for custom styles.
